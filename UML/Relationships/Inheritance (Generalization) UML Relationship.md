- **Example:** 
	 `Bird` is a superclass, and `Sparrow` is a subclass. 
	 `Sparrow` inherits characteristics from `Bird`.
	 
- **Superclass and Subclass:** 
	 The superclass is the more general class, and the subclass is more specific, inheriting attributes and behaviors from the superclass.
	 
- **Polymorphism:** 
	 Enables a variable, method, or object to take on multiple forms. 
	 Subclasses can be treated as instances of their superclass.
