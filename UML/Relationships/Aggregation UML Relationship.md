- **Symbol:** 
	 Hollow diamond at the end of a line connecting two classes.
	 
- **Meaning:** 
	 Signifies a "whole-part" relationship where one class is a part of another, but can exist independently.
	 
- **Example:** 
	 A `Car` class may have a relationship with a `Wheel` class, indicating that a car has wheels, but wheels can exist independently.
	 
- **Aggregation vs. Composition:** 
	 Aggregation implies a weaker relationship where parts can exist independently, while composition denotes a stronger relationship with a lifecycle dependency.
	 
- **Shared Aggregation:** 
	 Indicates that an instance can be shared among multiple aggregates.
