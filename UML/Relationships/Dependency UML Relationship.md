- **Symbol:** 
	 Dashed line with an arrow pointing from the dependent to the independent class.
	 
- **Meaning:** 
	 Represents a weaker relationship where a change in one class may affect another.
	 
- **Example:** 
	 Class `A` depends on class `B` if changes in `B` may affect `A`.
	 
- **Usage Dependency:** 
	 Denotes that one class uses another, but not necessarily in a structural way. 
	 It could be method parameters, return types, etc.
	 
- **Direct vs. Transitive Dependency:** 
	 A direct dependency occurs when one class directly depends on another. 
	 Transitive dependency occurs when there is an indirect dependency through a chain of intermediate classes.
