- **Symbol:** 
	 Solid diamond at the end of a line connecting two classes.
	 
- **Meaning:** 
	 Similar to aggregation but with a stronger connection. 
	 The part (inside) cannot exist without the whole (outside).
	 
- **Example:** 
	 A `House` class is composed of `Room` classes. 
	 If the house is destroyed, the rooms are also gone.
	 
- **Composition vs. Aggregation:** 
	 Composition implies a stronger relationship where the part cannot exist independently. 
	 It often involves ownership, and the destruction of the whole leads to the destruction of parts.
	 
- **Exclusive Ownership:** 
	 Denotes that each part is exclusively owned by one whole.
