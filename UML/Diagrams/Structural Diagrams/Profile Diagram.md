It allows you to define stereotypes, tagged values, constraints, and other custom elements that are not part of the standard UML metamodel.

### Key Components of a Profile Diagram:

1. **Profile:**
    
    - Represents a collection of stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints.
    - Displayed as a package containing the custom elements.
2. **Stereotype:**
    
    - Represents an extension or customization of a UML element, adding new properties or semantics.
    - Used to define domain-specific concepts.
    - Displayed in guillemets (<< >>) above the name of the stereotyped element.
3. **Metaclass:**
    
    - Represents a UML element to which a stereotype is applied.
    - It could be a class, interface, package, etc.
4. **Tagged Value:**
    
    - Represents additional information attached to a model element.
    - Used to provide additional properties or details specific to a stereotype.
    - Displayed as name-value pairs.
5. **Constraint:**
    
    - Represents a rule or condition that must be satisfied by elements of the profile.
    - Used to define constraints on the application of stereotypes.
    - Can be expressed using the Object Constraint Language (OCL).
