- Object Diagrams are dependent on the class diagram.

- Represent an instance of class diagram.

- It portrays the static view of an object-oriented system at a specific instant.

- Used to perform forward and reverse engineering.

- Used to build a prototype, model a complex data structure, or perceive the system from a practical perspective.

| Values are not involved.             | Values are not included.                     |
