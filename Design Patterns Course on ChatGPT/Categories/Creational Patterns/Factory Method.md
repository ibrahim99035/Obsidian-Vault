A design patterns that provide an interface to subclass to create objects from a superclass, but leaves the subclasses to choose the type of return.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Product
class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self):
        pass

### Concrete Products
class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "ConcreteProduct1 operation"

class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self):
        return "ConcreteProduct2 operation"

### Abstract Creator
class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        pass

    def some_operation(self):
        product = self.factory_method()
        result = f"Creator: {product.operation()}"
        return result

### Concrete Creators
class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct1()

### Concrete Creators
class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct2()

# Example usage
creator1 = ConcreteCreator1()
result1 = creator1.some_operation()
print(result1)  # Output: Creator: ConcreteProduct1 operation

creator2 = ConcreteCreator2()
result2 = creator2.some_operation()
print(result2)  # Output: Creator: ConcreteProduct2 operation
```

#### Use cases:
1. **Plugin Systems:** If you are building a system where different components or extensions (plugins) can be added dynamically, the Factory Method Pattern is useful. 
	- Each plugin can have its own factory method to create instances of specific classes.
	
2. **Framework Extensions:** In frameworks, the Factory Method Pattern is often used for extending or customizing the behavior of components. 
	- Subclasses can provide their own factory methods to create objects that fit into the framework.
