A creational design pattern that allows an object to create new instances by copying an existing object.

It is useful when the cost of creating an object is more expensive or complex than copying an existing one.

```python
import copy

class Prototype:
    def clone(self):
        # Using copy module for shallow copy
        return copy.copy(self)

class ConcretePrototype(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

# Example usage
prototype_instance = ConcretePrototype("Original Data")
clone1 = prototype_instance.clone()

print(prototype_instance.data)  # Output: Original Data
print(clone1.data)               # Output: Original Data

# Modifying the clone does not affect the original
clone1.data = "Modified Data"
print(prototype_instance.data)  # Output: Original Data
print(clone1.data)               # Output: Modified Data
```

### Use cases:
1. **Cloneable Objects:** Use the Prototype Pattern when you have objects that are expensive to instantiate but can be cloned to create new instances. 
	- This is common in scenarios where the cost of creating a new object involves complex operations or resource-intensive tasks.
2. **Configuration Management:** When your application needs to support different configurations, you can use the Prototype Pattern to create prototype objects representing various configurations. 
	- Clients can then clone these prototypes to get instances with specific settings.
