A design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

It involves creating a bridge interface, which is a separate abstraction layer, to decouple an abstraction's interface from its implementation.

```python
# Abstraction
class Abstraction:
    def __init__(self, implementation):
        self.implementation = implementation

    def operation(self):
        return f"Abstraction: {self.implementation.operation_implementation()}"

# Implementor Interface
class Implementor:
    def operation_implementation(self):
        pass

# Concrete Implementors
class ConcreteImplementorA(Implementor):
    def operation_implementation(self):
        return "ConcreteImplementorA operation"

class ConcreteImplementorB(Implementor):
    def operation_implementation(self):
        return "ConcreteImplementorB operation"

# Example usage
implementor_a = ConcreteImplementorA()
abstraction_a = Abstraction(implementor_a)
result_a = abstraction_a.operation()
print(result_a)
# Output: Abstraction: ConcreteImplementorA operation

implementor_b = ConcreteImplementorB()
abstraction_b = Abstraction(implementor_b)
result_b = abstraction_b.operation()
print(result_b)
# Output: Abstraction: ConcreteImplementorB operation
```

1. **Platform Independence:** When you want to separate the abstraction (e.g., user interface) from its implementation (e.g., operating system), allowing you to change or add new implementations without affecting the client code.
    
2. **Large Class Hierarchies:** When a class hierarchy becomes large and complex, the Bridge Pattern can be used to break it into smaller, more manageable parts.
