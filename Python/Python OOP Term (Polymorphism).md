**Polymorphism** is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. 

In the context of OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. 

This enables code to work with different types of objects in a uniform way.

#### Key aspects of polymorphism:
1. **Method Overloading:** Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name exist in a class but differ in the type or number of their parameters.
    
2. **Method Overriding:** Polymorphism is often associated with method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    
3. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes:** Polymorphism can be facilitated through the use of interfaces or abstract classes, where different classes provide their own implementations of common methods.
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Using polymorphism
def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(animal_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow!
```
