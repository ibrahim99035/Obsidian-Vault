In Python, the single underscore `_` and double underscore `__` are used as conventions to indicate the accessibility level of attributes in a class. 

1. **Single Underscore `_` (Protected)**:
   - A single leading underscore is a convention that indicates a variable or method is intended for internal use. (Read-Only)
   - It is considered a protected attribute, suggesting that it should not be accessed directly from outside the class or module.
   ```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
	    self._protected_variable = 42

    def _protected_method(self):
        print("This is a protected method.")
   ```

2. **Double Underscore `__` (Private Name Mangling)**:
   - A double leading underscore initiates name mangling, which changes the name of the attribute to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.
   - It makes the attribute harder to access from outside the class but doesn't provide true encapsulation or security.
   - The attribute name is transformed to `_classname__attribute` to make it less likely to clash with names in subclasses.
   ```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_variable = 42

    def __private_method(self):
        print("This is a private method.")
   ```
Example of name mangling:
   ```python
class Subclass(MyClass):
    def access_private(self):
        # This will not work directly; use the mangled name instead
        print(self.__private_variable)  # Raises AttributeError

        # Correct way to access the private variable
        print(self._MyClass__private_variable)  # Works
   ```

3. **No Underscore (Public)**:
   - If an attribute or method does not have a leading underscore, it is considered public and can be accessed from outside the class or module.
   ```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_variable = 42

    def public_method(self):
        print("This is a public method.")
   ```
